# War-Card-Game---Deacom
Card.java and KevinChangWarGame.java contain the java files of my war program. Please download those two files along with the jar file into a folder. 

To run the program, a batch file is needed which I can't provide because downloaders cannot run it due to security reasons. 
Please create the batch file following these steps:
  1. Open a text editor 
  2. Copy and past these 2 lines into a new file:
      java -jar KevinChangWarGame.jar

      pause
  3. Save the file as a .bat file in the folder with the 2 java files and the jar file 
  4. Run the .bat file and the war program should execute
